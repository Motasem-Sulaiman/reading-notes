# Event Driven Applications
 
 ## What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

 Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.


 ## What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

 Combining the strengths of OOP and event-driven programming allows for the creation of modular, reusable, maintainable, and scalable software systems. This approach is particularly useful in developing applications with graphical user interfaces, simulations, games, and other systems where events play a significant role.

 ## Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

 events are like signals that something has happened. These events can be various things, such as receiving a request from a client, reading data from a database, or even a timer ticking. When an event occurs, instead of waiting and blocking the program until it's completed, Node.js registers a callback function to handle that event and continues to listen for other events simultaneously.
