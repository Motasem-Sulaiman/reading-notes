## Why use Redux middleware?

Redux middleware is used to handle asynchronous actions in Redux applications. It provides a way to intercept and process actions before they reach the reducers, allowing for tasks such as making asynchronous API calls, logging, and more.

## Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.

In the Redux Async Data Flow, when an async action is dispatched, it typically involves three stages:
- The action is first dispatched, typically with a type and payload.
- Middleware, like Redux Thunk, intercepts this action, and if it's a function (thunk), it invokes it.
- Inside the thunk function, asynchronous operations, such as API requests, are performed, and new actions are dispatched based on the results.   - These new actions can be success or failure actions.
- Finally, the new action (success or failure) reaches the reducers, which update the application state accordingly.

## How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?

Async operations in a Redux app are accommodated by using Redux middleware, such as Redux Thunk. Redux Thunk enables action creators to return functions (thunks) instead of plain action objects. These thunks can handle asynchronous logic, making it possible to fetch data, update the Redux store, and trigger re-renders when the data is available.


## Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?
Redux Thunk middleware is needed when you want to handle asynchronous actions in your Redux application. It allows you to write action creators that return functions, enabling you to perform asynchronous tasks like API requests and dispatching actions with the fetched data.

## Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.

The return value from the inner thunk function will not be automatically made available to the rest of the application. However, you can use the dispatch function provided by Redux to dispatch actions from within the thunk function, and those actions can carry data or results of the asynchronous operation. These dispatched actions can then be handled by the reducers to update the Redux store as needed.
