## What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?
Some components need to synchronize with external systems. For example, you might want to control a non-React component based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. Effects let you run some code after rendering so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.

## How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?
When your component is added to the DOM, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. After your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.


## What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?
The return value often represents a function that is meant to clean up or undo the side effects caused by the effect's logic. This is crucial for managing resources like subscriptions, event listeners, timers, or any other external resources that need to be released when the effect is no longer needed. By returning a cleanup function, you ensure that your application doesn't leak resources and operates efficiently.
